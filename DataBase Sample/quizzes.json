The method shown is not the correct general procedure, even if the result happens to be right in this specific case. D) Incorrect: When subtracting fractions with the same denominator, subtract the numerators and keep the denominator: (3-1) / 4 = 2/4 (or 1/2). You never subtract the denominators.",
